                Health Development Initiative-Rwanda (HDI) is an independent,
                non-governmental, non-profit organization based in Kigali and
                registered with the Rwandan government. HDI strives to improve
                both the quality and accessibility of healthcare for all
                Rwandans through advocacy, education and training. HDI was
                founded in 2005 by a dedicated group of Rwandan physicians
                working in health facilities and communities across the country.
                This diverse group of health professionals was united by a
                shared commitment to improve the health of disadvantaged
                communities within and outside of the healthcare system. Today,
                HDI brings together a team with vast experience in medicine,
                public health, and community development to bridge the gap
                between communities and the healthcare system.

                HDI believes that health outcomes can be improved through
                parallel development of the community and the medical
                professionâ€™s capacity to support prevention, care and treatment
                of disease and illness. HDI supports community and health
                systems strengthening and works to empower individuals with
                tools and knowledge to advance the health of their communities,
                so that all Rwandans may lead healthy lives, free from
                preventable disease and premature mortality.
